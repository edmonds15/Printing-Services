# Printing Services
### A web application for Edmonds School District Print Shop requests
This is the code used in the Edmonds School District Printing Services page, which allows users to make requests to the ESD Print Shop.
This application was created using ASP.net, along with the [jQuery](https://jquery.com) for scripting and [jQuery UI](https://jqueryui.com) for styling.
Note that these files are for reference, and will not work by themselves.
You can find the published version [here](infosysapps.edmonds.wednet.edu/print) when connected to our network.
Thank You.
